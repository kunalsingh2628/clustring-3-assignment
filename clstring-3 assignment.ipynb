    "Clustering Concept:\n",
    "Clustering is a technique in machine learning and data analysis that involves grouping similar data points together based on certain criteria. The goal is to discover inherent patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without prior knowledge of group memberships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Segmentation: Cluster customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or preferences for targeted marketing strategies.\n",
    "Image Segmentation: Group pixels in an image based on color or intensity to identify objects or regions.\n",
    "Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns or outliers in network traffic, fraud detection, or system monitoring.\n",
    "Document Clustering: Organize documents into topics or themes based on their content.\n",
    "Genomic Data Analysis: Cluster genes based on expression patterns to identify relationships and potential biomarkers.\n",
